    <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

    <p>I remember as if it were a meal ago...</p>

    <p>
        Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have
        nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its
        demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome
        prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator â€” Tommy the cat
        had many a story to tell. But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.
